# minusshell test package
a test/template package for minus shell

## stuff for devs
so first there's some veeery important info i need to tell you

the first thing you should do is name your package in install.js (and the folder named "name" by default) 

then when you finally decide it's the time to ship the package, you should make an install script for it (i recommend doing it in /SHELL/temp/MSPM/(package name) for simplicity)

to make it installable through mspm, you need to add your package to [the main repo](https://github.com/negative-zero-inft/minusShellRepo) make your own repo (there will be a template soon)
